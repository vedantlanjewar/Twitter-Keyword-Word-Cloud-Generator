# Twitter-Keyword-Word-Cloud-Generator
This Python program retrieves 10,000 tweets from Twitter based on a keyword input, removes redundant words/phrases, and generates a word cloud visualizing the most frequent words. It uses Tweepy, NLTK, Matplotlib, and WordCloud libraries for accessing the API, text processing, and visualization.
